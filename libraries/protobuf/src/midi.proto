# Introduction

To generate material three protobuf messages must be supplied to the midigpt::sample function. The specification for each of these messages (Piece, Status and SampleParam) is outlined in this document. Any field which starts with internal_ should be ignored, as these are for internal use only. Or if you really know what you are doing ;). There are examples of midi::Piece, midi::Status and midi::SampleParam objects in the docs folder. For working examples, please consult the testing suite, which is found in MMM_API/src/midigpt_api/test/unit.cpp.

# Functionality Overview

| Functionality | Scope | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Velocity | Always Enabled | 32 levels of loudness for individual notes. |
| Instrument | Track | The General MIDI instrument (i.e. Timbre). |
| Max Polyphony Hard-Limit | Track | A hard-limit on the number of simultaneously sounding notes. |
| Note Duration (upper/lower soft bounds) | Non-Drum Tracks | Tells the model what the 15th (lower) and 85th (upper) quantiles of the note duration (i.e. Quarter, Whole) distrbution should be. |
| Polyphony (upper/lower soft bounds) | Non-Drum Tracks | Tells the model what the 15th (lower) and 85th (upper) quantiles of the polyphony distrbution should be. |
| Density (10 levels) | Drum Tracks | Tells the model the number of notes per bar to produce |
| Auto-regressive Sampling Mode | Track | When enabled, bars are always sampled in chronological order. |
| Time Signature | Bar | A unique time-signature can be specified for each bar. |
| Temperature | per API call | A higher value increases entropy of generated output. Temperature=1 applies no modification to the probabilities produced by the model. |
| Context size (model_dim) | per API call | The number of bars that the model can process in one API call |


# Parameter Constraints and Considerations

There are two sampling methods: autoregressive generation, where we progressively sample musical material forwards in time on each track; and conditional generation (bar-infilling), where generated material is conditioned on past and future material.

Note that a single call the the model midigpt:sample() may involve both autoregressive and conditional generation, as these can be specified on a per-track basis. These constraints are 

## Sample Param Constraints

1. tracks_per_step :
  - must be on range [1,number of tracks in piece]

2. bars_per_step :
  - must be on the range [1,model_dim]
  - for conditional generation it is ill-advised for the user to have bars_per_step == model_dim, as this means generation will not be conditioned on any bars

3. shuffle :
  - this only applies in cases where one or more tracks are conditionally generated (i.e. resample = False && 1+ selected_bars = True)

4. percentage :
  - this only applies in cases where one or more tracks are conditionally generated (i.e. resample = False && 1+ selected_bars = True)

## Status Constraints

1. density :
  - this control only applies to drum tracks. This works will both infilling and autoregressive mode.

2. note duration / polyphony :
  - this control only applies to non-drum tracks. This works will both infilling and autoregressive mode.

3. autoregressive :
  - you can only enable autoregressive mode (resample = True) when all the bars are selected in a track.
  - note you may have autoregressive disabled when all bars are selected in a track

4. ignore :
  - bars which have 1+ selected_bars = True may not be ignored, as they are needed to condition the generation
